////////////////// CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = KSO-NorthPoleBase
	title = Delivery of the scientific mission to the north pole
	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program
	
	description = Spatan Kerman, Deputy Chief Scientific Officer thinks that the agency now has a very good knowledge of 1000m circle 
	around KSC, and therefore itâ€™s time to make a small step forward. We want to make a large set of experiments near the north pole in
	order to check the abilities of kerbals and mechanisms to live and operate in an extremely cold environments. This would definitely 
	help in preparation to our upcoming space missions (as we all know how cold is there in space). We want you to deliver two of our 
	scientists to the north pole so they could establish a temporary base in order to begin experimenting.
	
	synopsis = Deliver scientists team consisting of 3 to their place at the polar ice caps to begin preparation to establish the base.
	
	notes = Land a team of kerbals at the specified point and disembark them. Then return the craft safely back to KSC
	
	completedMessage = Team is there!\n\n It is cold as hell and they seem to turn blue instead of natural green. This leads us to suggestion that we can control the kerbals color by varying the temperature. What a beautiful scientific perspective!
